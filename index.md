## Bio
My research combines materials science and solid mechanics to create, understand, and advance the next generation of materials for energy, health care, transportation, and beyond. My career goal is being a professor who inspires and equips students to be excellent engineers.

## Research
My current research focus is solid-state, structural battery development via atomic layer deposition, under the guidance of Neil Dasgupta. This expands upon my dissertation focus of characterizing fatigue in a unique class of functional-structural materials called shape memory alloys, which was under the guidance of Samantha Daly and John Shaw. By both building new materials with vapor deposition and characterizing their properties with advanced experiments, I can "close the loop" in materials design, creation, and characterization.

## Teaching
I have always enjoyed helping others learn, and in graduate school, I discovered that my passion for teaching extends into formal classroom and mentoring settings, too. During my Ph.D., I mentored undergraduate students on their own research projects; delivered guest lectures for several courses; developed and delivered a course on renewable energy for senior citizens; and served as a graduate student instructor for a junior-level mechanics of materials course. Through these experiences, my desire to become an engineering professor has been affirmed.

Along with in-person teaching and mentoring, I have created resources to help wider audiences gain knowledge. One example is a website for learning digital image correlation (DIC). This experimental technique is exploding in popularity and has been especially useful for the experiments in my dissertation. When I began using DIC, there was not a single document or resource for learning how to execute high-quality DIC experiments, so I agglomerated a slew of best practices from the literature and published them online: [digitalimagecorrelation.org](http://digitalimagecorrelation.org/). 

## Selected publications
1. __LePage W__, Ahadi A, Lenthe W, Sun QP, Pollock T, Shaw J, Daly S. Grain size effects on NiTi shape memory alloy fatigue crack growth. _Journal of Materials Research_, (invited feature paper), 2017. [https://doi.org/10.1557/jmr.2017.395](https://doi.org/10.1557/jmr.2017.395)<br /><br />
Major findings:
	+ a new external scanning technique for SEM-DIC largely eliminated the drift, distortion, and scanning errors that otherwise require lengthy scan times and/or extensive post-processing to achieve accurate results
	+ macroscopic fatigue crack growth correlated well with microscopic crack tip observations: the grain sizes with relatively fast macroscopic crack growth rates exhibited large crack displacements at the microscale, and vice versa
	+ crack closure was observed with SEM-DIC on the microscale (not with an indirect measurement like crack mouth gages), and crack closure in the 1500 nm grain size was suspected to slow its crack growth rate<br />

Major findings:
	+ because black paint absorbs light and white paint scatters light, black paint has superior contrast over a basecoat of white paint than the converse sequence
	+ patterns with black speckles had a 24% lower median normalized false displacement (0.87 μm) than the patterns with white speckles (1.14 μm), shown below as a cumulative distribution function (CDF)
	+ the optimium painted speckle pattern for DIC is a random pattern of black speckles applied with about 50% density over a basecoat of white paint<br />

Major findings:
	+ during continued cycling, dead Li accumulates and impedes ionic mass transport, requiring a greater concentration gradient for diffusion
	+ this accumulated dead Li is responsible for capacity fade in Li metal full cells, before dendrite shorting or electrolyte depletion occur
	+ voltage measurements during galvanostatic cycling indicate mass transport effects by changing from "peaking" to "arcing"<br />

Major findings:
	+ expedient method for optimizing a popular and powerful experimental mechanics technique, optical digital image correlation (DIC)
	+ eliminates saturated pixels to preserve sub-pixel displacement resolution
	+ improves correlation confidence interval by about 10%
	+ reduces 2-D DIC error by up to 60%<br />
