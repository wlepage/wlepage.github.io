My passion in research is improving the performance and durability of structural, functional, and energy materials. My thesis investigates the fatigue and fracture mechanics of shape memory alloys with techniques that redefine the limits of experimental mechanics. I'm also studying the coupled mechanical, electrochemical, and thermal interactions of lithium metal anodes for next-generation batteries. After completing my PhD, I seek to be a professor who prepares and inspires students to serve people and the planet through science and engineering.

## Research

Technologies to combat climate change require advancements in materials for lightweight structures and energy storage systems. My research focuses on understanding and enhancing the durability limits of energy materials, with an emphasis on shape memory alloys and lithium metal batteries. 

Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are unique metals that are most commonly used in biomedical devices such as stents and root canal files, but can also be leveraged to make weight-saving actuators with exceptionally low mass and high specific power. Currently, SMA actuators are limited in their cyclic capacity and confound durability predictions because of their complex phase transformations. New insights on the fundamental damage mechanisms in SMAs will enable more cyclic durability, better failure predictions, and new frontiers for lightweight structures with these promising materials.

In addition, I investigate the connections between battery performance and the coupled mechanical, thermal, and electrochemical properties of materials for next-generation batteries with lithium metal anodes.

En route to building new understandings about material degradation and failure, I am developing novel experimental frameworks to characterize material responses with unprecedented breadth and precision between the millimeter and nanometer length scales, as well as among mechanical, electrical, chemical, and thermal potentials. 

One experimental technique that has been especially useful in my research is digital image correlation (DIC). When I began using DIC, there was not a single document or resource for learning how to execute high-quality DIC experiments, so I agglomerated a slew of best practices from the literature. Recently, I published a website that summarizes the fundamentals and best practices of DIC. I continue to maintain this website for the experimental mechanics community, and especially for new students and other novice users of DIC: [digitalimagecorrelation.org](http://digitalimagecorrelation.org/).

Major findings:
	+ a new external scanning technique for SEM-DIC largely eliminated the drift, distortion, and scanning errors that otherwise require lengthy scan times and/or extensive post-processing to achieve accurate results
	+ macroscopic fatigue crack growth correlated well with microscopic crack tip observations: the grain sizes with relatively fast macroscopic crack growth rates exhibited large crack displacements at the microscale, and vice versa
	+ crack closure was observed with SEM-DIC on the microscale (not with an indirect measurement like crack mouth gages), and crack closure in the 1500 nm grain size was suspected to slow its crack growth rate<br />

Major findings:
	+ because black paint absorbs light and white paint scatters light, black paint has superior contrast over a basecoat of white paint than the converse sequence
	+ patterns with black speckles had a 24% lower median normalized false displacement (0.87 μm) than the patterns with white speckles (1.14 μm), shown below as a cumulative distribution function (CDF)
	+ the optimium painted speckle pattern for DIC is a random pattern of black speckles applied with about 50% density over a basecoat of white paint<br />

Major findings:
	+ during continued cycling, dead Li accumulates and impedes ionic mass transport, requiring a greater concentration gradient for diffusion
	+ this accumulated dead Li is responsible for capacity fade in Li metal full cells, before dendrite shorting or electrolyte depletion occur
	+ voltage measurements during galvanostatic cycling indicate mass transport effects by changing from "peaking" to "arcing"<br />

Major findings:
	+ expedient method for optimizing a popular and powerful experimental mechanics technique, optical digital image correlation (DIC)
	+ eliminates saturated pixels to preserve sub-pixel displacement resolution
	+ improves correlation confidence interval by about 10%
	+ reduces 2-D DIC error by up to 60%<br />
