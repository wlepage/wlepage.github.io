I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Michigan, Department of Mechanical Engineering. My thesis investigates the fatigue and fracture of shape memory alloys with techniques that redefine the limits of experimental mechanics. After completing my PhD, I aspire to be an engineering professor who cultivates a dedication to helping people and the planet though engineering.
