## Research
My goal in research is forging the next-generation of materials by "closing the loop" in materials design, creation, characterization, and development through experimental approaches like DIC and manufacturing tools like ALD:

![Closing the loop in structural materials: advanced experimental mechanics for new insights of damage informs precise surface engineering for improved structural materials.](img/approach-01.png "Closing the loop in structural materials: advanced experimental mechanics for new insights of damage informs precise surface engineering for improved structural materials.")<br />
For my doctoral dissertation, I investigated the fatigue and fracture mechanics of shape memory alloys with new techniques for digital image correlation (DIC). For my postdoctoral research, I am developing solid-state batteries that can be incorporated into structural composites, as well as corrosion protection strategies for aluminum and magnesium. For both the solid-state battery electrodes and the corrosion protection layers, I am leveraging the precise thickness and composition control of atomic layer deposition (ALD). Moving forward, I am eager to connect my dissertation and postdoc skills for both studying and creating materials and structures.

## Selected publications

Lithium Mechanics: Roles of Strain Rate and Temperature and Implications for Lithium Metal Batteries. _Journal of The Electrochemical Society_, 2019. [https://doi.org/10.1149/2.0221902jes](https://doi.org/10.1149/2.0221902jes).<br /><br />
Major findings:
	+ the mechanical response of Li was measured in inert gas environments over a wide range of strain rates and temperatures
	+ a power-law creep model was calibrated to predict Li deformation as a function of strain rate and temperature
	+ power-law creep is the dominant deformation mechanism over a wide range of battery-relevant conditions<br /><br />

Major findings:
	+ a new external scanning technique for SEM-DIC largely eliminated the drift, distortion, and scanning errors that otherwise require lengthy scan times and/or extensive post-processing to achieve accurate results
	+ macroscopic fatigue crack growth correlated well with microscopic crack tip observations: the grain sizes with relatively fast macroscopic crack growth rates exhibited large crack displacements at the microscale, and vice versa
	+ crack closure was observed with SEM-DIC on the microscale (not with an indirect measurement like crack mouth gages), and crack closure in the 1500 nm grain size was suspected to slow its crack growth rate<br />

Major findings:
	+ expedient method for optimizing a popular and powerful experimental mechanics technique, optical digital image correlation (DIC)
	+ eliminates saturated pixels to preserve sub-pixel displacement resolution
	+ improves correlation confidence interval by about 10%
	+ reduces 2-D DIC error by up to 60%<br />
