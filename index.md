## Research
For my postdoctoral research, I am developing solid-state, structural batteries via atomic layer deposition (ALD), under the guidance of Neil Dasgupta. In my dissertation, I investigated the fatigue and fracture mechanics of shape memory alloys with new techniques for digital image correlation (DIC), under the guidance of Samantha Daly and John Shaw. Together, my dissertation and postdoc skills are a useful combination for both studying and creating materials and structures. Moving forward, I want to drive the next-generation of materials by "closing the loop" in materials design, creation, characterization, and development through experimental approaches like DIC and manufacturing tools like ALD.

## Teaching
I have always enjoyed helping others learn, and in graduate school, I discovered that my passion for teaching extends into formal classroom and mentoring settings, too. During my Ph.D., I mentored undergraduate students on their own research projects; delivered guest lectures for several courses; developed and delivered a course on renewable energy for senior citizens; and served as a graduate student instructor for a junior-level mechanics of materials course. Through these experiences, my desire to become an engineering professor has been affirmed.

Along with in-person teaching and mentoring, I have created resources to help wider audiences gain knowledge. One example is a website for learning digital image correlation (DIC). This experimental technique is exploding in popularity and has been especially useful for the experiments in my dissertation. When I began using DIC, there was not a single document or resource for learning how to execute high-quality DIC experiments, so I agglomerated a slew of best practices from the literature and published them online: [digitalimagecorrelation.org](http://digitalimagecorrelation.org/).

+ __LePage W__, Ahadi A, Lenthe W, Sun QP, Pollock T, Shaw J, Daly S. Grain size effects on NiTi shape memory alloy fatigue crack growth. _Journal of Materials Research_, (invited feature paper), 2017. [https://doi.org/10.1557/jmr.2017.395](https://doi.org/10.1557/jmr.2017.395)<br /><br />
Major findings:
	+ a new external scanning technique for SEM-DIC largely eliminated the drift, distortion, and scanning errors that otherwise require lengthy scan times and/or extensive post-processing to achieve accurate results
	+ macroscopic fatigue crack growth correlated well with microscopic crack tip observations: the grain sizes with relatively fast macroscopic crack growth rates exhibited large crack displacements at the microscale, and vice versa
	+ crack closure was observed with SEM-DIC on the microscale (not with an indirect measurement like crack mouth gages), and crack closure in the 1500 nm grain size was suspected to slow its crack growth rate<br />

Major findings:
	+ expedient method for optimizing a popular and powerful experimental mechanics technique, optical digital image correlation (DIC)
	+ eliminates saturated pixels to preserve sub-pixel displacement resolution
	+ improves correlation confidence interval by about 10%
	+ reduces 2-D DIC error by up to 60%<br />
